			 Stem::Id Design Notes

The Stem::Id module generates unique Id strings for use as names in Stem
addresses. Its most common use is by parent Cells which clone themselves
and need a unique Target. The parent Cell uses its Cell name and the new
Target to register the cloned Cell.

A typical use is by a Stem::SockMsg Cell which creates a Stem::Id object
during its own construction. When this parent Cell accepts a socket
connection, it clones itself and needs to register this new Cell with a
unique address.  The parent Cell calls the next method of its Stem::Id
object to get a unique Id which is uses for the Target address of the
cloned Cell. Then the cloned Cell is registered with the parent Cell
name and the new Target name. This address is then sent to other Cells
so they can communicate with this new Cell.

This module is only used internally and should not be configured.

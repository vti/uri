		       Stem::Socket Design Notes

The Stem::Socket module provides an interface to create connected
sockets. It can either connect to a remote socket as a client or listen
for connections as a server. Its constructor takes an owner object, an
optional host or IP address and a required port number. Also a boolean
flag designates whether is it a client or server. If no host argument is
provided, it will default to localhost. To make a server listen on any
IP address (with the wild card INADDR_ANY), pass in the empty string ''
as the host.

When a socket connection is made (either a client or a server), the
owner object is notified by a callback and the handle of the newly
created socket is passed to it. Since a client socket can timeout when
connecting to a server, a timeout value can be set. If the connection
request times out a different method is used as the callback to the
owner object.

This module is only used internally and should not be configured.
